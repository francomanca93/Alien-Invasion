# Alien-Invasion
I'm making a game with Python to learn how structure a project and use GitHub.

This project you can show in the book "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition - Part II: Projects.

Also to reinforce my English writing skill I'm coding all of its in English. 

I'm write a description of the general gameplay. 
This following description does not cover every detail of Alien Invsaion but it provides a clear idea in general.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
